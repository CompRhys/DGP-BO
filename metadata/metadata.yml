name: Hierarchical Gaussian Process-Based Bayesian Optimization for Materials Discovery
  in High Entropy Alloy Spaces
description: "Bayesian optimization (BO) is a powerful and data-efficient method for
  iterative materials discovery and design, particularly valuable when prior knowledge
  is limited, underlying functional relationships are complex\nor unknown, and the
  cost of querying the materials space is significant. Traditional BO methodologies
  typi\x02cally utilize conventional Gaussian Processes (cGPs) to model the relationships
  between material inputs and\nproperties, as well as correlations within the input
  space. However, cGP-BO approaches often fall short in\nmulti-objective optimization
  scenarios, where they are unable to fully exploit correlations between distinct
  material properties. Leveraging these correlations can significantly enhance the
  discovery process, as information\nabout one property can inform and improve predictions
  about others. This study addresses this limitation by\nemploying advanced kernel
  structures to capture and model multi-dimensional property correlations through\nmulti-task
  (MTGPs) or deep Gaussian Processes (DGPs), thus accelerating the discovery process.
  We demonstrate the effectiveness of MTGP-BO and DGP-BO in rapidly and robustly solving
  complex materials design\nchallenges that occur within the context of complex multi-objective
  optimization over FCC FeCrNiCoCu high\nentropy alloy (HEA) spaces, where traditional
  cGP-BO approaches fail. Furthermore, we highlight how the\ndifferential costs associated
  with querying various material properties can be strategically leveraged to make
  the\nmaterials discovery process more cost-efficient."
